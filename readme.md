# Motion Activated LED strip with LDR and PIR sensors and Arduino

An embedded system project built to control an LED strip based on motion detection and ambient light using **PIR** and **LDR sensors**. This system intelligently adjusts its behavior based on the environment, ensuring efficient light control and minimal false triggers.

## üöÄ Features
- **Motion-based lighting**: LED strip turns on when motion is detected.
- **Light detection**: LDR detects light using a moving average filter for smooth detection.
- **Debounce logic**: Avoids false motion detection through consistent PIR sensor readings.
- **Hysteresis**: Ensures stable light state near threshold values.
- **Watchdog timer**: Periodically verifies system status to avoid misbehaving due to glitches or external interference.
- **Lockout period**: Prevents the LDR from detecting the LED strip‚Äôs own light during operation.

## üß† How it Works

### üåó Light Detection (LDR)
- The system samples **3 LDR readings** at a time, calculates the **moving average**, and checks if the environment is bright or dark.
- **Threshold with hysteresis**: To avoid flickering, a threshold value is set with a **hysteresis range** to change the state only when the reading goes beyond a certain limit.
- **Buffer**: The LDR readings are stored in a **circular buffer**, ensuring real-time data processing.

### üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Motion Detection (PIR)
- The system reads the **PIR sensor** in **debounced intervals** to prevent false motion triggers.
- **Motion count** is accumulated over several readings, ensuring valid motion is detected if more than half the readings detect motion.

### üí° LED Control
- **LED strip turns on** when motion is detected, and turns off when the environment is bright.
- **Lockout period** prevents feedback from the LED strip, ensuring stable light control.
- **LED state** is only updated if the state has changed, reducing unnecessary writes to the LED control pin.

### ‚è≤Ô∏è Watchdog Timer
- A **watchdog function** runs periodically to check if the actual pin output for the LED matches the state of `ledsEnabled`. If there is a mismatch, it corrects the issue and logs the error.
